# US-Higher-Education-Economic-Trends
In a group project for a time course, myself and two classmates performed trend/seasonality and ARIMA analysis on college cost, starting salary, and student loan data time-based data from 1968-2021. We also created a VARX model on those three series with inflation, GDP, and population as exogenous factors to explore lead/lag relationships.
